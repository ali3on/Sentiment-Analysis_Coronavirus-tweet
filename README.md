Sentiment Analysis Text Classification with Coronavirus tweet

The Coronavirus pandemic has caused panic and health concerns all around the world. More and more social websites use their platforms to share news and opinions about the pandemic. In order to make the best and proper use of the resources, we used NLP machine learning methods for sentiment analysis of Coronavirus tweets. Recognizing Coronavirus sentiment from tweets can make optimized informed decisions.

In this project, we are using sentiment analysis to process the detection of positive, neural or negative sentiment in text to Coronavirus. 
There are 44955 (forty four thousand nine hundred and fifty five )tweets in total 

We create a baseline approach using CountVectorizer and Linear SVC and then try to make more complex solutions in order to get a better result in Td-idf feature extractions with KNN, Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest and Logistic Regression.
